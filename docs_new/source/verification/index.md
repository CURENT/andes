## Verification Approach

ANDES models are verified against:
- PSS/E simulation results
- TSAT simulation results
- Published benchmark data

## Test Systems

### IEEE 14-Bus
Standard test case for basic verification with synchronous generators and exciters.

### NPCC 140-Bus
Northeast Power Coordinating Council equivalent for inter-area dynamics.

### WECC 179-Bus
Western Electricity Coordinating Council equivalent for large-scale validation with renewable generation.
