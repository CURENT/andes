   "source": "# Frequency Response and Load Shedding\n\nSystem frequency is a direct indicator of the real power balance between generation and load. When a generator trips unexpectedly, the remaining generators must pick up the lost generation through their turbine governors. If the generation shortfall is too large, frequency will decline until it stabilizes at a new (lower) value determined by the governor droop characteristics, or protective relays will disconnect loads to restore balance.\n\nThis tutorial demonstrates how to study frequency response in ANDES by simulating a generator trip and then implementing load shedding to restore frequency. These techniques are essential for understanding power system resilience and designing emergency control schemes.\n\n:::{note}\n**Prerequisites:** Complete {doc}`04-time-domain` for disturbance simulation and {doc}`10-dynamic-control` for multi-stage simulation techniques.\n:::"
