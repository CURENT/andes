    "# Eigenvalue Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Eigenvalue analysis (also called small-signal stability analysis) examines how a power system responds to small perturbations around its operating point. By linearizing the nonlinear differential-algebraic equations and computing the eigenvalues of the resulting state matrix, we can determine whether the system is stable and identify the oscillatory modes that dominate its dynamic behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis is fundamental to understanding inter-area oscillations, local plant modes, and control interactions. The location of eigenvalues in the complex plane tells us about stability: eigenvalues with negative real parts indicate stable modes (perturbations decay), while eigenvalues with positive real parts indicate unstable modes (perturbations grow). The imaginary part relates to the oscillation frequency.\n",
