# v2.0

[x] separated Routine config into `create_config` and `set_config`.

[x] Move model config into `Model.create_config`. Add `Model.set_config`.
[x] Decouple SymProcessor from Model
[x] Decouple config from Model
[x] Decouple ModelCache and __setattr__ hacks from Model.
- Think about how the symprocessor output should be stored in a general
  data structure.
  - Separate the input to the intermediate processor and the input to the code
    writer
- Decouple Documenter from Model
- Decouple data storage from Model
  - Turn the `adder`, `setter` manager into a class
  -
- Decouple addresser from system (?)
  - Depend on the number of (online) devices and number of variables
- Remove `ModelCall` from `Model`
- Consider consolidating `ModelData` and `Model`
- Major: move symbolic model definition to `Model.define`.


# v1.5

## Milestones

* Separate array-enabled parameters from NumParam into
  `BaseConvParam`, which implements `iconvert` and `oconvert`,
  and then `ListParam`
[x] Improve the robustness of accessing the fields of `pycode` by properly
    handling `KeyError`s.
[x] Numba code generation for all models. Add a function for triggering
    all the JIT compilation before simulation. `andes prep -c` does it.
* Unit Model Test framework - a difficult task. Testing models will
  require proper inputs (from external models), addressing from the system,
  proper initialization, and the coupling with integration methods.

# Later Versions

* Center-of-inertia for rotor angle and speed.
* Allow selection of output variables
* Timeseries data input support. Reading data from file.
* `PQTS` model for PQ with time-series.
* Generalize two-terminal and multi-terminal devices
* Allow for semi-analytical derivation of equations
* Define general hooks - when should the connectivity check happen
* Vectorize the `enable` option for most discrete blocks.
* allow to remind developer of missing equations (such as `vout` of Exciters).

## Help Wanted

* Restore compatibility with dome format
* Draw block diagram from symbolic models using BDP (or SchemDraw)
* Eigenvalue analysis report sort options: by damping, frequency, or eigenvalue
* Root loci plots

### To-do bullets

* [X] Clearly define interface variables `VarExt`
* [X] Define associated equation with each variable (internal of interface)
* [X] Use SymPy/SynEngine to generate function calls - define the interfaces
* [X] Use SymEngine to get the derivative for each model; the derivatives may store in a smaller matrix locally to the model
* [X] Pickle/dill the auto-generated function calls on the first run
* [X] Function for providing the jacobian triplet
* [X] Implement a PV model with the old code - Partially done with the Hybrid `j_numeric`

* [X] Dummy service variables for storing initial values (such as pm0, vref0) (Solved with `Service` itself)
* [X] Improve running functions based on routine. Get rid of passing around `is_tds`. Possibly implementing a

`pflow_models` and a `tds_models` list in system

* [X] Implement a group for PV and Slack. Possibly implementing all groups in `group.py`
* [X] Implement index handling in `group.py`, update `link_external` to work with groups (Let group implement

similar api to models.idx2uid, or implement a `get_by_idx` for both)

* [X] Let Synchronous generator subsitute PV; more generally, let any non-pflow model substitute a pflow one

(Currently done with `v_numeric` )

* [X] Prototype Connectivity checking, previously implemented as `gyisland`. Need to be implemented under

`System` (It turns out that `gy_island` and `gisland` does not need to be implemented. If there is a large
mismatch, just let the power flow fail and let the user correct the data.)

* [X] Prototype a Bus voltage average for area (COI-type of one-to-multiple aggregation model

(RefParam, SericeReduce and RepeaterService)

* [X] Divide limiter to update_var and update_eq (such as anti-windup limiter which depends on equations)

* [X] Clean up `System._get_models`; Clean up the use of model-dependent calls
* [X] Clearly define `reset` and `clear` (`clear` clears the values but retains the size;  `reset` resets

attributes to a state before setup)

* [X] Fix the case when Area is not a `TDS` model but has an equation `time = dae_t` which does not get updated

during TDS. (a non- `tds` model is not allowed to use `dae.t` )

* [X] Implement a trapezoidal rule for numerical integration
* [X] Refactorize jacobian after critical time (works for implicit method)

* [X] Per-unit conversion (get ExtParam Sn, Vn before per unit conversion - Yes)
* [X] LaTeX names in blocks and limiters

* [X] Quadratic and exponential saturation for generators
* [X] Piecewise nonlinear functions (block. Piecewise)

* [X] Batch simulation with in-place parameter modification (implemented with `Model.alter()`)
