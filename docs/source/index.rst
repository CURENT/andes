LTB ANDES is an open-source Python library for power system modeling, computation,
analysis, and control, serving as the core simulation engine for the CURENT Large scale
Testbed (LTB). It supports power flow calculation, transient stability
simulation, and small-signal stability analysis for transmission systems. ANDES
implements a symbolic-numeric framework for rapid prototyping of
differential-algebraic equation-based models. In this framework, a comprehensive
:ref:`library of models <modelref>` is developed, including the full
second-generation renewable models. Models in ANDES have been :ref:`verified
<verification>` with commercial software.

    Model development guide
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Looking to implement new models, algorithms, and functionalities in ANDES?
    The development guide provides in-depth information on the design
    philosophy, data structure, and implementation of the hybrid
    symbolic-numeric framework.

    API reference
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    The API reference contains a detailed description of the ANDES package. The
    reference describes how the methods work and which parameters can be used.
    It assumes that you have an understanding of the key concepts.
