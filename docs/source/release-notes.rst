Release Notes
=============

The APIs before v3.0.0 are in beta and may change without prior notice.

v1.5 Notes
----------

v1.5.8 (2021-12-xx)
```````````````````
- Full initialization debug message will be printed only when
  ``-v 10`` and ``run --init`` are both used.
- Improved warning of out-of-limit initialization. Variables
  initialized at limits will be shown only at the debug level.
- Initialization improvements for models ``REGCA1`` and ``REECA1``.
- Added model ``HYGOV``.
- Changed the default ``vout`` of offline exciters to zeros.
  All ``vout`` equations need to be multipled by ``ue``.

v1.5.7 (2021-12-11)
```````````````````
This minor release highlights the improved debugging of initialization.

Highly verbose initialization output can be enabled when the verbose
level is 10 or less. For example,

.. code:: bash

    andes -v 10 run test.xlsx -r tds --init

will set the verbose level to 10 and run ``test.xlsx`` in the current
folder, proceed to time-domain simulation but only initialize the models.
Outputs will be printed to the shell where the command is executed.

To save the output to a file, use the following in a UNIX shell:

.. code:: bash

    andes -v 10 run test.xlsx -r tds --init > info.txt 2>&1

where the first ``>`` pipes the output to a file named ``info.txt``,
and ``2>&1`` appends stderr (2) to stdout (1).

The other main improvement is allowing automatic limit adjustment
during initialization. Due to parameter errors, some variables
will be initialized to values outside the given limits.
Most commercial software does not attempt to fix the parameter
but rather adjust the limit in run time.

The same approach is followed in ANDES by automatically adjusting
the upper limit, if exceeded, to variable initial values.
The lower limit, however, is kept unadjusted by default.

Discrete components now take an argument named ``allow_adjust``
so that the model developer can specify if its limits can be
adjusted or must be kept as is.
Each model is allowed to specify three config flags to customize
runtime behaviors: ``allow_adjust``, ``adjust_lower``,
and ``adjust_uppwer``. By default, ``allow_adjust=True``,
``adjust_upper=True``, and ``adjust_lower=False``.
One can modify the config file to enable or disable the
limit adjustments for specific models.

Other fixes include:

- Bug fixes for ``GAST`` parameter ``AT``.
- Bug fixes for ``IEEET3``, ``GAST``, ``ESAC1A`` and ``ESST1A``
  when device is off to avoid matrix singularity.

v1.5.6 (2021-11-25)
```````````````````
- Allow specifying config options through command-line arguments
  ``--config-option``.
- Added a voltage and frequency playback model ``PLBVFU1``.
- Bug fixes to an SEXS equation.

v1.5.5 (2021-11-13)
```````````````````
- Added a `Timeseries` model for reading timeseries data from xlsx.
- Converted several models into Python packages.
- Bug fixes to TGOV1 equations (#226)

v1.5.4 (2021-11-02)
```````````````````
- Fixed a bug in generated ``select`` functions that omitted the
  coefficients of ``__ones``.

v1.5.3 (2021-10-31)
```````````````````
- Revered special arguments for the generated ``select`` function.
- Stabilized the argument list of pycode. If the pycode is identical
  to existing ones, the existing file will not be overwritten.
  As a result, compiled code is fully cached.
- Partially seperated time-domain integration method into ``daeint.py``.

v1.5.2 (2021-10-27)
```````````````````
- Removed ``CVXOPT`` dependency.
- Removed ``__zeros`` and ``__ones`` as they are no longer needed.

- Added ``andes prep -c`` to precompile the generated code.
- Added utility functions for saving and loading system snapshots.
  See ``andes/utils/snapshot.py``.

- Compiled numba code is always cached.
- Bug fixes.

v1.5.1 (2021-10-23)
```````````````````
- Restored compatibility with SymPy 1.6.
- Added a group for voltage compensators.
- New models: ``IEEEVC`` and ``GAST``.

v1.5.0 (2021-10-13)
```````````````````
- Support numba just-in-time compilation of all equation and Jacobian calls.

This option accelerates simulations by up to 30%.
The acceleration is visible in medium-scale systems with multiple models.
Such systems involve heavy function calls but a rather moderate load
for linear equation solvers.
The speed up is less significant in large-scale systems where
solving equations is the major time consumer.

Numba is required and can be installed with ``pip install numba`` or
``conda install numba``.

To turn on numba for ANDES, in the ANDES configuration under ``[System]``,
set ``numba = 1`` and ``numba_cache = 1``.

The just-in-time compilation will compile the code upon the first execution
based on the input types.
When compilation is triggered, ANDES may appear frozen due to the compilation lag.
The option ``numba_cache = 1`` will cache compiled machine code, so that
the lag only occurs once until the next ``andes prep``.

- Allow ``BackRef`` to populate to models through ``Group``.

When model `A` stores an ``IdxParam`` pointing to a group, if ``BackRef``
with the name `A` are declared in both the group and the model,
both ``BackRef`` will retrieve the backward references from model `A`.

- Allow ``BaseVar`` to accept partial initializations.

If ``BaseVar.v_str_add = True``, the value of `v_str` will be added in place
to variable value.
An example is that voltage compensator sets part of the input voltage, and
exciter reads the bus voltage. Exciter has `v.v_str_add = True` so that
when compensators exist, the input voltage will be bus voltage (vbus) plus
(Eterm - vbus).
If no compensator exists, exciter will use bus voltages and function as expected.

- Added reserved variable names ``__ones`` and ``__zeros`` for ones and
  zeros with length equal to the device number.

``__ones`` and ``__zeros`` are useful for vectorizing ``choicelist``
in ``Piecewise`` functions.

``andes prepare`` by more than half.

- ``andes prepare`` supports multiprocessing and uses it by default.
- Added aliases ``andes st`` and ``andes prep`` for
  ``andes selftest`` and ``andes prepare``.
- ``andes.config_logger`` supports setting new ``stream_level`` and
  ``file_level``.

- Added ``AC8B``, ``IEEET3`` and ``ESAC1A``.

Other changes include disallowing numba's ``nopython`` mode.

- Refactored Service equation generation so that the exact arguments are
  passed.

Also contains an experimental Python code dump function.

- Allow `Model.alter` to update service values.

v1.0.2 (2020-06-01)
```````````````````
- Patches the conda-forge script to use SymPy < 1.6. After SymPy version

```````````````````

  typical values. Warnings will be issued when out of bound or equality/
  inequality conditions are not met.
- Allow internal variables to be associated with a discrete component which
  will be updated before initialization (through `BaseVar.discrete`).

  For ``kundur_ieeest.xlsx``, simulation time is down from 2.50 sec to 1.64 sec.
- The side-effects include a change in variable ordering in output lst file.

  ``SymProcessor`` and ``Documenter`` classes.

This update contains a quick but significant fix to boost the simulation speed by avoiding
calls to empty user-defined numerical calls.

- In `Model.flags` and `Block.flags`, added `f_num`, `g_num` and `j_num` to indicate
  if user-defined numerical calls exist.
- In `Model.f_update`, `Model.g_update` and `Model.j_update`, check the above flags
