ANDES can be used as a command-line tool or a library.
The command-line interface (CLI) comes in handy to run studies.
As a library, it can be used interactively in the IPython shell or the Jupyter Notebook.
This chapter describes the most common usages.

Please see the CLI `cheatsheet`_ if you are looking for quick help.
